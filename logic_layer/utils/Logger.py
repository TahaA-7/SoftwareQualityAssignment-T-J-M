Log
The system should log all activities. All suspicious activities must be flagged, and the system needs to
produce an alert/notification for unread suspicious activities once a System Administrator or Super
Administrator is logged in to the system. The content of the log file(s) must be encrypted and should be
only readable through the system interface, by the System Administrator or Super Administrator. It
means that it should not be readable by any other tool, such as file explorer, browser or text editor.
